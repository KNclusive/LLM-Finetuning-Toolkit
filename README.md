# LLM-Finetuning-Toolkit

A comprehensive collection of Jupyter Notebooks and scripts for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) using Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques. This toolkit is designed to streamline the process of adapting pre-trained models to specific tasks, enabling efficient customization without extensive computational resources.

## üß∞ Features

- **PEFT Implementations**: Utilize advanced methods like LoRA and QLoRA for efficient model adaptation.
- **Diverse Model Support**: Fine-tune models such as LLaMA, Falcon, Bloom, and GPT-Neo-X.
- **Colab Integration**: Seamless execution of notebooks in Google Colab for easy experimentation.
- **Safety and Robustness**: Incorporate safety alignment techniques to ensure model reliability.
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Detailed guides and examples to facilitate understanding and usage.
